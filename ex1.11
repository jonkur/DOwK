Ping-pong app and Log output app now share a persistent volume on a node.
First, make sure k3d cluster is up and running, some <port> is forwarded to 80, then create a store directory inside agent-0 container with
  docker exec k3d-k3s-default-agent-0 mkdir -p /tmp/kube
Now spin up both apps from this folder with
  kubectl apply -f logoutput/manifests/
  kubectl apply -f pingpongapp/manifests/
  
 Logoutput reader should now be running in localhost:<port> and the ping-pong app in localhost:<port>/pingpong
 The amount of ping/pongs should be visible on the logoutput report and it should also persist after shutting down and restarting the deployment.
