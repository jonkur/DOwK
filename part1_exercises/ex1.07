First make sure that a k3d cluster is running, and that some port is forwarded to 80@loadbalancer node. For example:
  k3d cluster create --port 8082:30080@agent:0 -p 8081:80@loadbalancer --agents 2
Also make sure that no other ingresses are loaded.

Then simply start the deployment, service and ingress for the logoutput app with:
  kubectl apply -f logoutput/manifests/
  
App should now be running at port 8081 (or whatver port you chose to forward to 80).
