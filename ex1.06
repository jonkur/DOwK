Project now has a service.yaml manifest that can be used to start a NodePort service.
First make sure that the cluster is running and some host port (8082 for example) is forwarded to the port 30085 on one of the agent nodes. 
(Using k3d node edit --port-add on the running loadbalancer instance also seems to work fine).
Then apply the deployment, if not already deployed, with
  kubectl apply -f manifests/deployment.yaml
Then apply the service we just created with
  kubectl apply -f manifests/service.yaml
  
App should now be reachable at localhost:<host port you picked>
