Make sure that there is a cluster running and a <port> forwarded to 80 and also a store directory set up with:
	docker exec k3d-k3s-default-agent-0 mkdir -p /tmp/kube
Then
	kubectl apply -f /logoutput/manifests/
    kubectl apply -f /pingpongapp/manifests/

Logoutput app runs in localhost:<port>, pingpongapp in localhost:<port>/pingpong
Logoutput app now fetches the count of pongs from pingpongapp using cluster-internal http endpoint,
instead of reading from a file.
