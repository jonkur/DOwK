Picture loading and caching has been added to the project. Seems to works, even if the code is a complete mess at this point.
Again, make sure that there is a cluster running and a port forwarded to 80 and also a store directory set up with:
	docker exec k3d-k3s-default-agent-0 mkdir -p /tmp/kube
Then
	kubectl apply -f /project/manifests/
