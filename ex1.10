Logoutput app has now been split to two different apps running on the same pod.
The other generates and saves the timestamp, and the the other responds with the latest timestamp upon GET request to /.
Make sure there is a k3d cluster running and set up with some <port> forwarding to 80 and start simply with
  kubectl apply -f manifests/
in the logoutput folder.
