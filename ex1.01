Deploying the logoutput app to a cluster:
  -Make sure Docker, k3d and kubectl are installed
  -Init a cluster with two agent nodes with "k3d cluster create -a 2"
  -Create a new deployment with the logoutput app with "kubectl create deployment logoutput-dep --image=jkur00/logoutput"
  -Get the name of the generated pod from the output of "kubectl get pods"
  -Stream the stdout from the pod running the app with "kubectl logs -f <pod name>"
